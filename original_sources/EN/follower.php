	<H3>The competition task </H3>
	<P>
		To build a autonomous mobile robot, which will travel the 
		whole defined path in a certain time. The direction and course
		is defined by the dark line, also some obstacles are presented. 
	</P>

	<H3>The path</H3>
	
	<p>
		The background of the path will be white with dark (black) navigation line 
		on it (width 15 +/- 1 mm). Total length of the path won't be more than 
		20 meters. Material used will be a chipboard.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The smallest radius of curves used in the path will be 5 cm
		Total rising of the path won't exceed 3 cm; maximal rising or declining is 5%. 
		Like in the real life, there can be random obstacles in the path (interrupted 
		navigation line, obstacle on the line, illumination changes and other).
	<p>
		The robot's task is not to find the right way, just to follow the navigation 
		line. The line remains unchanged for the duration of the competition, so robot 
		can learn from previous runs and for example complete straight stages in a 
		faster time.
	</p>
	
	<P>
		The path is closed (round), and in the start (that is also the finish) area
		will be short (10 cm) perpendicular dark stripe on the line located. This stripe
		will mark the start/end to help recognize it for fully autonomous self-learning
		robots. So can the robot better utilize the information from previous runs.
		If the strip is not necessary, the robot can start just after the
		strip on the path. 
	</P>
	
	<P>
		The time measurement is stopped when the similar beam of light located at 
		the end of the path is interrupted.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		There are no barriers at the edge of the contest area. On the each side
		of the dark line will be the 15 cm wide safety area. Nevertheless, it is
		recommended to implement the safety device to avoid the fall from the edge.
		Organizers can not guarantee that area around the arena will be open. Hence
		the authors used to carefully evaluate the sensor measurements, especially
		near the arena edges.

	<H3>Robot operation</H3>

	<P>
		There must not be any interference between the robot and its team after the
		robot is set in the starting circle and turned on. The robot must be
		controlled only by its electronics. 
	</P>
	
	<P>
		The robot may not leave the line after crossing the starting line. Avoiding 
		obstacles is the only one exception. While moving, the robot may not leave 
		any marks or beacons on the table. No parts can remain on the path during 
		the run.
	</P>
	
	<P>
		The competitor is disqualified when the competition path is damaged.
	</P>
	
	<H3>Dimensions and size of the robot</H3>

	<P>
		The width and height of the robot cannot exceed 20 cm.
		Length of the robot is not limited.
		Please, notify the limits given by tunnels and circle radiuses during the run.
	</P>
	
	<P>
		Minimal dimensions and weight are not limited. 
	</P>

	<H3>The competition and the order of the competitors</H3>

	<P>
		The competitors must be prepared to the start within 1 minute after the
		call. Every robot has total  3 runs to compete. But if the
		competitor does not present within 1 minute after the call, the run is
		lost. The time between the runs can be used for fixing and adjusting the robot.  
		In the case of too many competitors, the jury can decrease the number of runs, 
		or it can proclaim a qualifying round.
	</P>
	
	<H3>Time limits</H3>

	<P>
		The robot has 3 minutes to complete the path. After 3 minutes, 
		the time measurement is stopped and the run is canceled. 
		But the robot is not 
		disqualified. The time stop has no affect on the next runs.
	</P>

	<H3>Evaluation and prices</H3>

	<P>
		Each registered robot after reaching the end of line will be rewarded with the
		diploma. The winner is the robot with the shortest time from any of the three
		runs. The jury can also award the robot with the best design or interesting
		construction.
