	<h3>Task</h3>
	<P>
		The task is to design and build an autonomous, microcontroller controlled
		mobile robot, which will correctly move the ketchup cans in the stock.
		Each time two opposite robots compete. The winner is who faster and
		better fulfill its task.  
	</P>
	
	<h3>Ketchup</h3>
	<P>
		The robot task is to move as much ketchup cans as possible to its
		home line. 	
	</P>
	
	<P>
		Ketchup is stored in a steel tinned can with diameter 53 mm (+/- 1 mm)
		and height 74 mm (+/- 1 mm). The mass of the full can (with the content)
		is approximately 163 grams (+/- 5 g). 
	<P Align="center">

		<I>Tomato ketchup in can. Available in regular groceries.</I>
	</P>

	<h3>Stock</h3>

	<P>
		The stock is represented by the network of 5 horizontal and 
		5 vertical lines with the distance 30 cm (+/-1cm). Horizontal lines
		are numbered 1-5, vertical are labeled A-E. Lines are black, their 
		width is 15 mm (+/- 1mm). Lines are meant as a navigational aid, 
		it is not necessary to move along them. 
	</P>
	
	<P>
		The base is horisontal, white. It's made of plastic, rubberized fibre
		or similar material. When the base will be not made of single piece, 
		then the connections shouldn't create steps larger than 1&nbsp;mm. 
		Slope changes shouldn't exceed 4 degrees.
	</P>
	
	<P>
		At the start robots are placed on intersections A3 and E3. Vertical line
		A is called home line for the first robot, vertical line E is home line
		of the second robot.   
	</P>
	
	<P>
		There are 4 cans in the game. At the beginning, there are always two ketchups
		at the positions C2 and C4. Another two will be placed on some of the B2, B3, 
		B4 resp. D2, D3, D4 positions symmetrical. Those two positions are choosed 
		before the each run randomly. 
	</P>
	
	<P Align="center">
		<IMG Src="./images/KetchupStart.png" Alt=""></br>
		<I>Robots are on positions A3, E3. Two cans are always at the C2 
		and C4. Another two are located on two from yellow circles, e.g. 
		B2 and D4.</I>
	</P>

	<h3>Robot - storeholder</h3>

	<P>
		Robot has to be autonomous. During the contest there is no external
		influencig allowed. 
	</P>
	
	<P>
		Length and width of the robot has to be less than 30&nbsp;cm. When the
		robot changes its dimensions during the contest, in any instant moment
		the dimensions can't exceed 30&times;30&nbsp;cm. Height of the robot
		is not limited. Cans are not counted to the robot dimensions.
		Please, notice also the dimensions of the stock and place
		required for turns. 
	</P>
	
	<P>
		It is allowed to move also apart from lines, they are considered just
		as a means for navigation. During the robots movement it cannot place
		any traces or markings. No part of the robot can stay on the base. 
	</P>

	<h3>Activity of the robo</h3>

	<P>
		The basic task is to identify cans in the stock and to move them 
		beyound its home line. Is is allowed to move also the opponents cans. 
		Damaging of the opponnents robot is strictly forbidden. 
	</P>
	
	<P>
		Before the start, robots are placed on their initial positions.
		On the referee signal they are activated by owners who then immediately
		move back and no more interact with the robots. After the time
		limit are robots immediately deactivated by their owners.
	</P>
	
	<P>
		Cans can be moved using any technique (push, pull, roll,...). 
		Also more than one can at the time can be moved. Robot may
		move in any direction, as the lines are meant just as a 
		navigational aid.
	</P>
	
	<P>
		After the finish the number of cans on the home line is evaluated.
		The can is scored only when at least its small part touches the
		home line. It is not necesserily in the crossection.
	</P>
	
	<P>
		Number of cans in the home line represents score of the robot
		in a given lap. The contest will run in round robin tournament.
		In the case of large amount of participants the robots will be
		divided into the smaller groups.
	</P>
	
	<P Align="center">
		<IMG Src="./images/KetchupEnd.png" Alt=""></br>
		<I>Green robot wins - it has 3 cans in his home line, while the
		blue one only 1. After the finish the robot can stop anywhere, 
		not necesserily on his home line.</I>
	</P>
	
	<P>
		Ketchups are counted after the finish. Until then, robots can
		them mutually &quot;steal away&quot;.
	</P>

	<h3>Sequence of contestants</h3>

	<P>
		Contest sequence will be determined immediately before the
		contest.
	</P>
	
	<P>
		Throughout the contest, the algorithms, settings, and 
		components on the robot can be shaped, angled, or configured 
		differently for facing each opponent. 
	</P>

	<h3>Time limits</h3>
	
	<P>
		The robot must be ready within 1 minute after callm, otherwise its
		match is lost. Each match takes 3 minutes. If both contestants agree, 
		the match can be stopped also sooner. 
	</P>

	<h3>Evaluation and prices</h3>
	
	<P>
		Winner of the tournament is the robot with the highest score. 
		If during the tournament no points will be scored, jury will
		determine the winner based on the overall succesfullness - e.g.
		how close was the can to the home line, whether the movement
		was coordinated or just random etc.
	</P>
	
	<P>
		The jury may also consider to award the most interesting or 
		more beautiful constructions etc. 
	</P>
